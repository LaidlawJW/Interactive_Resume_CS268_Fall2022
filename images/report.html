<h1>How this webpage has met the requirements:</h1>
<ol>
    <li>The client is Professor Gomes, and therefore not an author of the webpage.</li>
    <li>The website comes with a complete header for every page.</li>
    <li>The website comes with an index, home, about me, pedagogy, posts, an edit page for posts, research, an edit page for research, students, and a confirmation page - that makes 10 pages.</li>
    <li>There is a working navbar with links.</li>
    <li>Both large and small screens are supported for all pages.</li>
    <li>The global.css file allows for maintaining a coherent style throughout the website. Every page has an individual stylesheet that styles its unique content.</li>
    <li>All images' alt attributes are accounted for and accurately describe the picture used.</li>
    <li>Every page has a favicon.</li>
    <li>All images, css, and javascript are stored in the correctly named directories.</li>
    <li>N/A</li>
    <li>All files are named only using alphanumeric charatcers.</li>
    <li>All content is neatly aligned and soothing to the eye. The axes are clearly visible on each page, where clear separation can be observed.</li>
    <li>The site has at least two font faces. For example, one is used in the header, and another is used in the footer.</li>
    <li>The website contains 3 pages including forms that allow for insertion or deletion of elements using various requests. However, Professor Gomes approved this number in a recent deliberation.</li>
    <li>The site includes external links to Professor Gomes' LinkedIn, UWEC profile page, Web of Science page, and Google Scholar page. All of these pages are opened in a new tab when their links are clicked.</li>
    <li>Code formatting is consistent and makes sense semantically. Use of whitespace and tab delimiters are used to improve readability and are employed consistently. Class names and ids for items are relevant to their position on the page, their purpose, or both.</li>
    <li>Each page has a fade-in animation when loaded. Additionally, the header and navbar use their own unique animations. All animations are powered by CSS.</li>
    <li>The site is able to use MYSQL databases for storing and retrieving data, and are put to use on the pages that contain forms.</li>
    <li>N/A</li>
